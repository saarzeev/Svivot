<h5>About Aragorn</h5>
<span><P>
  Among Aragorn's numerous hobbies one can find Hobbits guiding, throne seating and walking around Minas Tirith (meaning The White City, often called The City of Kings and originally named Minas Anor).
  <br/>
  Aragorn is most interested in the fields and Data Mining and particularly excelled in the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
  Aragron thinks Data Mining is of paramount importance, as Aragorn's databases are 210 years old, and contain hundreds of Yobibytes (that is 2 to the 80th power bytes).
  <br/>
  Aragorn expects this course to allow him to become a part-time front-end developer, as his reign as King of Gondor is now peacefull and mundane.

  Aragorn II, son of Arathorn is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He is one of the main protagonists of The Lord of the Rings. Aragorn was a Ranger of the North, first introduced with the name Strider at Bree, as the Hobbits continued to call him throughout The Lord of the Rings. He was eventually revealed to be the heir of Isildur and rightful claimant to the thrones of Arnor and Gondor. He was also a confidant of Gandalf and an integral part of the quest to destroy the One Ring and defeat the Dark Lord Sauron.
</p></span>

<span><p>
Aragorn led the Fellowship of the Ring following the loss of Gandalf in the Mines of Moria while fighting the Balrog. When the Fellowship was broken, he tracked the hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took with the help of Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf to Fangorn Forest. He then fought in the battle at Helm's Deep and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. After defeating Sauron's forces in Gondor, he led an army of Gondor and Rohan against the Black Gate of Mordor to distract Sauron's attention so that Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee could have a chance to destroy the One Ring.
</p></span>

<span><p>
At the end of The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn was crowned King Elessar Telcontar ("Elfstone Strider") of Gondor. He married Elrond's daughter, Arwen, and assumed the Sceptre of Annúminas as King of Arnor, uniting the two kingdoms for the first time since the reign of Isildur.

<H5>Ans</H5>
<br/>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<br/>
<table>
  <caption>Key differences between the different Web generations:</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Category</th>
    <th>Web 1.0</th>
    <th>Web 2.0</th>
    <th>Web 3.0</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="category">Content creator</td>
    <td>Webmaster</td>
    <td>Webmaster, users</td>
    <td>Webmaster, users, computers and nodes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="category">Users role</td>
    <td>Reader</td>
    <td colspan="2">Reader and writer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="category">Owners of content</td>
    <td>Companies</td>
    <td>People, "simple" users</td>
    <td>People build applications</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>
<p>
Question 2:
</p>
<p>
  If I were to look for the definition Web 1.0, while using Web 1.0, I'd probably get W3C website, with a definition of what is Web 1.0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the other hand, If I were to look it up on Web 3.0, I'd probably get into a site much like Stackoverflow, where numerous users have already 
  asked a similar question, and still other users have replied in different ways. The answers would be ranked by relevance by the users of the site.
